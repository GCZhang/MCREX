Year 1:

Demonstrate convergence properties and performance of MCSA algorithm on sparse
symmetric and non-symmetric systems.

Year 2:

Show resiliency of MCSA algorithm for soft and hard errors while solving the
linear advection-diffusion-reaction (ADR) model problem.

Year 3:

Show parallel performance of MCSA algorithm on existing HPC architectures and
demonstrate scaling to exascale systems using the MCSA performance model.
