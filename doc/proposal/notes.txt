NOTES WHILE PREPARING PROPOSAL
==============================

* Somewhere we may want to mention that when the residual is large everywhere,
  MCSA may lose efficiency.  The MC part of the solve is most efficient when
  the residual is large in only a few parts of the vector space.

* 40 node+GPU per node (24 cores per node) Cumulus computing cluster is
  available for performance and resiliency modeling

* xSIM can be used to do Performance Modeling verification

* define model problems with references (ADR and incompressible Navier-Stokes)

* casl reference
