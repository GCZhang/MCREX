Almost Optimal {M}onte {C}arlo ({MAO)} algorithms for solving eigenvalue problems are formulated. Results for the structure of both – systematic and probability error are presented. It is shown that the values of both errors can be controlled independently by different algorithmic parameters. The results present how the systematic error depends on the matrix spectrum. The analysis of the probability error is presented. It shows that the close (in some sense) the matrix under consideration is to the stochastic matrix the smaller is this error. Sufficient conditions for constructing robust and interpolation {M}onte {C}arlo algorithms are obtained. For stochastic matrices an interpolation {M}onte {C}arlo algorithm is constructed. A number of numerical tests for large symmetric dense matrices are performed in order to study experimentally the dependence of the systematic error from the structure of matrix spectrum. We also study how the probability error depends on the balancing of the matrix.},

	abstract = {Three {M}onte {C}arlo methods for matrix inversion ({MI)} and finding a solution vector of a system of linear algebraic equations ({SLAE)} are considered: with absorption, without absorption with uniform transition frequency function, and without absorption with almost optimal transition frequency function. Recently Alexandrov, Megson, and Dimov have shown that an n×n matrix can be inverted in {3n/2+N+T} steps on a regular array with O(n2 {NT)} cells. Alexandrov and Megson have also shown that a solution vector of {SLAE} can be found in {n+N+T} steps on a regular array with the same number of cells. A number of bounds on N and T have been established (N is the number of chains and T is the length of the chain in the stochastic process; these are independent of n), which show that these designs are faster than existing designs for large values of n. In this paper we take another implementation approach; we consider parallel {M}onte {C}arlo algorithms for {MI} and solving {SLAE} in {MIMD} environment, e.g. running on a cluster of workstations under {PVM.} The {M}onte {C}arlo method with almost optimal frequency function performs best of the three methods; it needs about six to ten times fewer chains for the same precision.},

Comparisons are made with iterative {M}onte {C}arlo methods with degree one.

The following estimate on N is obtained: {N=Nc/(cN+bN1/2c)2}, where Nc is the number of chains in the usual degree one method. In addition it is shown that b\&gt;0 and that {N\&lt;Nc/c2N.} This result shows that for our method the number of realizations N can be at least {c2N} times less than the number of realizations Nc of the existing {M}onte {C}arlo method.

	abstract = {{M}onte {C}arlo ({MC)} linear solvers can be considered stochastic realizations of deterministic stationary iterative processes. That is, they estimate the result of a stationary iterative technique for solving linear systems. There are typically two sources of errors: (i) those from the underlying deterministic iterative process and (ii) those from the {MC} process that performs the estimation. Much progress has been made in reducing the stochastic errors of the {MC} process. However, {MC} linear solvers suffer from the drawback that, due to efficiency considerations, they are usually stochastic realizations of the Jacobi method (a diagonal splitting), which has poor convergence properties. This has limited the application of {MC} linear solvers. The main goal of this paper is to show that efficient {MC} implementations of non-diagonal splittings too are feasible, by constructing efficient implementations for one such splitting. As a secondary objective, we also derive conditions under which this scheme can perform better than {MC} Jacobi, and demonstrate this experimentally. The significance of this work lies in proposing an approach that can lead to efficient {MC} implementations of a wider variety of deterministic iterative processes.},

It was shown there that effective techniques could reduce computation times dramatically (speed-up factors of 550 to 26,000 were obtained in sample calculations).

Contrast this convergence rate with , which is the rate of statistical error reduction for conventional {M}onte {C}arlo methods. Thus, residual {M}onte {C}arlo methods hold great promise for increased efficiency relative to conventional {M}onte {C}arlo methods. Previous research has shown that the application of residual {M}onte {C}arlo methods to the solution of continuum equations, such as the radiation transport equation, is problematic for all but the simplest of cases. However, the residual method readily applies to discrete systems as long as those systems are monotone, i.e., they produce positive solutions given positive sources. We develop a residual {M}onte {C}arlo method for solving a discrete {1D} non-linear thermal radiative equilibrium diffusion equation, and we compare its performance with that of the discrete conventional {M}onte {C}arlo method upon which it is based. We find that the residual method provides efficiency gains of many orders of magnitude. Part of the residual gain is due to the fact that we begin each timestep with an initial guess equal to the solution from the previous timestep. Moreover, fully consistent non-linear solutions can be obtained in a reasonable amount of time because of the effective lack of statistical noise. We conclude that the residual approach has great potential and that further research into such methods should be pursued for more general discrete and continuum systems.},
